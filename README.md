# apodbot

Astronomy Picture of the Day Slack Bot

## Purpose

Post the image and text from [apod.nasa.gov](https://apod.nasa.gov) each day to Slack channel. We acknowledge that several projects already exist that do the same thing, but we wanted to learn how to do it ourselves.

## Usage

This code relies on the following packages: `slackclient`, `urllib2`, `json`, `uuid`, and `datetime`.

## People
